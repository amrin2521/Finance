# Credit Risk Analysis (Logistic Regression)

This is a project I worked on to better understand how logistic regression can be used to predict credit defaults. I used synthetic financial data to simulate real-world scenarios where companies might default on their bonds. The goal was to go through the full process — from cleaning the data to training and evaluating a classification model — in a way that felt hands-on and practical.

## What I Did

- Cleaned and organized the dataset to make it usable
- Explored patterns in the data through visualizations
- Trained a logistic regression model to classify defaults
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC score

## What's in This Repo

- `notebook/credit_model_analysis.ipynb`: This notebook contains all my work — data prep, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of packages I used (if you want to recreate the environment).

## How to Run It

1. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
