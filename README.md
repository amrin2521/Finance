# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis (Logistic Regression)


Predicting corporate bond defaults using Python, synthetic financial data, and classification models.

This project explores how logistic regression can be applied to predict corporate bond defaults. Using synthetic financial data, I simulated real-world scenarios where companies may default, focusing on the full data science pipeline — from data cleaning and exploration to model training and evaluation.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand default risk in corporate finance using classification techniques
- Explore relationships between key financial indicators and default likelihood
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate statistical metrics

## 📁 What's Included

- `notebook/credit_model_analysis.ipynb`: Full notebook with data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation
- `requirements.txt`: All Python packages needed to run the notebook

## 🧠 Methods & Tools

- **Logistic Regression** (sklearn)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** with `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, AUC Score
